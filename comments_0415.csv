	1618486376.0	News and information out of GameStop has been dropping left and right lately. I'm excited for more news that could drop today or through the end of the week. We can still expect the 2021 Meeting proxy documents, and an official press release from gamestop regarding the search for a CEO that Reuters reported. Gamestop is still operating with an interim CFO, so they may still announce a hire for that position. I wonder what other surprises are in store? ******** 8 April: [GameStop Announces Slate of Director Candidates for 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-slate-director-candidates-2021-annual-meeting) 12 April: [Reuters reports Gamestop is searching for a replacement for CEO ](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gamestop-ceo-exclusive/exclusive-gamestop-initiates-search-for-new-ceo-sources-idUSKBN2BZ290) 13 April: [GameStop Announces Voluntary Early Redemption of Senior Notes](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-voluntary-early-redemption-senior-notes-0) 14 April: [Gamestop SEC filings show forfeiture of 706,096 total shares by CEO Sherman and EVP/CMO Homeister for failing to meet performance goals.](https://news.gamestop.com/financial-information/sec-filings)	YouAreAPyrate	42010	14011	170

	1618496932.0	"# Guys I can't believe some of you still dont understand.This will moon when AND ONLY WHEN there is a forced buyback :man_facepalming_light_skin_tone: **How to achieve forced buyback?** 1. Share recall 2. Margin call 3. Small raw buying pressure to push unhedged new options ITM so that hedging provides 'free' upward movement on TACTICAL MOMENTS ONLY. 4. Forced liquidation by DTCC 5. Hard intervention by the SEC Unless one of these happens, the price can go anywhere.... and it doesn't matter if it's $200 or $40 a share... **Red days dont mean the squeeze is off, green days dont mean the squeeze is on. The price is fucking irrelevant (unless you're buying, then big red days are something to celebrate)** You should stop caring. We've been saying this for months, but everytime we have a green day you guys want to celebrate and cheer because ""where lambo"" like a bunch of spoiled children. And on red days you freak out way too much. **Get fucking patient** For those 5 catalysts that I listed there are many things 'in the works'. The DTCC is spewing new regulations like a toddler that ate too much icecream. There is a shareholder vote 9th of June, GME hasn't released what we'll be voting on however. SEC just got a new head that is known to be anti hedgefund bullshit. **What is important?** \- Buy if you can. This determines how much exposure you have once we moon. More shares is more tendies. \- HOLD. Seriously. Don't daytrade, don't sell. Just hold. Doesn't matter if we're down 50% or up 40%. Stop giving a shit. This will only moon if there are not enough shares to go around. By holding, you are taking your shares and you're saying ""These are mine now. Less to go around"". \- Stop fucking promising yourselves dates. Especially if you're smoothbrained. Don't get excited at all. Stop it. You're setting yourself up for constant dissapointment which will paperhand you and ruin this for yourself. Yesterday I told you not to overcelebrate and I was told to fuck off and not ruin the fun. See where the fun yesterday got you? Totally (and without good reason) totally dissapointed today. **Not fucking advice, go ahead and be stupid if you think that's better**"	Damsellindistress	32909	10903	552
	1618499641.0	"# you dumb apes want to hear a secret? Max pain is at 150 :man_shrugging_light_skin_tone: Long whales are going to defend that point to bleed large option owners. You know who owns lots of options? People who needed to buy them to reset FTDs and huge short positions. That's who. We will hover around 150 all day and that is a good thing for us. ""Red bad, green good"" is such an ape-unworthy simpleminded approach to this. Grow some wrinkles for gods sake. Do you want $200 as a price today if that helps shorts by letting them make a shitload of money on options? If you're saying yes then you're seriously almost a real ape. **Smart apes know that to win the war you don't have to win every battle.

I’m not selling until either an absurd number in a squeeze, or until I more than double my initial investment if the squeeze never comes because the system is broken, so I stopped watching. I’ll check periodically just to see, but at this point, there’s really no reason for me to look. I have my shares that I will hold, so any small price fluctuations don’t do me any good to watch.

Do you one better: the S.E.C has their own judges so technically they can legit do whatever the fuck they please under their own scrutiny. They operate outside traditional federal courts. For example daddy musk and Cuban didn’t go into a federal court for their hearing they went to an S.E.C court with an S.E.C appointed judge getting tried for securities fraud by S.E.C employees/lawyers.	plomii	22723	936	45

	1618489833.0	So I was thinking about how Gamestop is really entering the E sports arena. The fact is that most great marketing results in recognition of names and that name tells a history, and path. So whats the best way to name it. Well we want the name to not only tell what they are but what they do. This led me to think ok lets just call it the E SPORTS CHANNEL or ESC. However this is where I figured out the perfect name for their channel and what they are doing. They can pay homage to the APEs that helped saved Gamestop by throwing all their crayons and wendys paychecks at Gamestop. Thus we can combine the two and call this new venture, ESCAPE. This will be the lead for Gamestop's new Esports channel. So obviously I eat crayons for fun, huff paint, and am the smoothest of brains but I think this tribute to us apes with us being memorialized would be amazing.	Physical_Inspector	9156	90	15

	1618509019.0	" **What IS important?** \- Buy if you can. This determines how much exposure you have once we moon. More shares is more tendies. \- HOLD. Seriously. Don't daytrade, don't sell. Just hold. Doesn't matter if we're down 50% or up 40%. Stop giving a shit. This will only moon if there are not enough shares to go around. By holding, you are taking your shares and you're saying ""These are mine now. Less to go around"". \- Stop fucking promising yourselves dates. Especially if you're smoothbrained. Don't get excited at all. Stop it. **Not fucking advice, go ahead and be stupid if you think that's better** you dumb apes want to hear a secret? Max pain is at 150 :man_shrugging_light_skin_tone: Long whales are going to defend that point to bleed large option owners. You know who owns lots of options? People who needed to buy them to reset FTDs and huge short positions. That's who. We will hover around 150 all day and that is a good thing for us. ""Red bad, green good"" is such an ape-unworthy simpleminded approach to this. Grow some wrinkles for gods sake. Do you want $200 as a price today if that helps shorts by letting them make a shitload of money on options?

Hedge funds apparently did the stock market equivalent with GME shares.

	1618498356.0	"# Guys I can't believe some of you still dont understand.This will moon when AND ONLY WHEN there is a forced buyback **How to achieve forced buyback?** 1. Share recall 2. Margin call 3. Small raw buying pressure to push unhedged new options ITM so that hedging provides 'free' upward movement on TACTICAL MOMENTS ONLY. 4. Forced liquidation by DTCC 5. Hard intervention by the SEC Unless one of these happens, the price can go anywhere.... and it doesn't matter if it's $200 or $40 a share... **Red days dont mean the squeeze is off, green days dont mean the squeeze is on. The price is fucking irrelevant (unless you're buying, then big red days are something to celebrate)** You should stop caring. We've been saying this for months, but everytime we have a green day you guys want to celebrate and cheer because ""where lambo"" like a bunch of spoiled children. And on red days you freak out way too much. **Get fucking patient** For those 5 catalysts that I listed there are many things 'in the works'. The DTCC is spewing new regulations like a toddler that ate too much icecream. There is a shareholder vote 9th of June, GME hasn't released what we'll be voting on however. SEC just got a new head that is known to be anti hedgefund bullshit. **What is important?** \- Buy if you can. This determines how much exposure you have once we moon. More shares is more tendies. \- HOLD. Seriously. Don't daytrade, don't sell. Just hold. Doesn't matter if we're down 50% or up 40%. Stop giving a shit. This will only moon if there are not enough shares to go around. By holding, you are taking your shares and you're saying ""These are mine now. Less to go around"". \- Stop fucking promising yourselves dates. Especially if you're smoothbrained. Don't get excited at all. Stop it. You're setting yourself up for constant dissapointment which will paperhand you and ruin this for yourself. Yesterday I told you not to overcelebrate and I was told to fuck off and not ruin the fun. See where the fun yesterday got you? Totally (and without good reason) totally dissapointed today. **Not fucking advice, go ahead and be stupid if you think that's better** # you dumb apes want to hear a secret? Max pain is at 150 :man_shrugging_light_skin_tone: Long whales are going to defend that point to bleed large option owners.You know who owned lots of options?

	1618493377.0	This won't apply to the vast majority of you, but I think this will be both helpful and encouraging to some. I had all my shares in Robinhood ( I know, I know, spare me the ridicule), but I was always hesitant to transfer because I was worried the squeeze would take place while my shares were in limbo sitting between brokerages. However, I decided to transfer half of my shares to Fidelity, that way, if this thing pops off during the extended transfer time, I could still theoretically have control of the remaining half still in Robinhood (assuming they don't pull fuckery again). All that being said, I initiated the transfer of half my shares yesterday morning before market open, and I'm thrilled to say that the transfer completed a few hours ago, and I woke up to the wonderful email informing me of such. So, if you feel stuck with Robinhood like I was, I encourage you to use the method that I did, and you should be good to go regardless, and you'll hopefully find that the transfer will take place much faster than expected.

He says he was invested, but admitted to paper handing when it was on the way down the first time (he sold at a hundred for higher than he bought in). He said he regrets it, but just didn't have the stomach for it. Not everyone does! He wished me luck on my trip to the moon, though.

	1618499969.0	This might sound cheesy, but when my father passed away, we had to sell our vacation home in Florida- I know, super priviledged to have had one in the first place, but it really hurt to lose the place we had so many happy memories in. So when we moon, I want to try and buy an apartment there, or at least have enough for a down payment. And then I was thinking- why not have an Apes Anonymous meetup at like Universal Studios or something? Nice and public, so you could escape from potential incels, but also: We're going to need some serious coaster action to make up for our GME-adrenalin loss afterwards.

	1618577098.0	DFV’s Walter Mitty tweet? I’ve never seen the movie, so I went to Wikipedia (where else) to get sum straight factz. What I found in the plot synopsis was, well, shocking!: “Walter Mitty is a negative assets manager at Life magazine who daydreams of adventures... Mitty works with legendary photojournalist Sean O'Connell, although they have never met in person. O'Connell has sent Mitty his latest negatives... The negative is missing, forcing Walter to stall for time with corporate transition manager Ted Hendricks, who is handling the downsizing.” Negatives assets going missing, and stalling for time until they can be retrieved? Sounds a lot like FTDs and naked shorts right? There’s a ton more in there but it all gets a bit tin-foilly. ‘Negative assets’ really stood out for me, took my smooth brain a while to figure out they were talking about photos but it’s the kind of smart cryptic breadcrumb that DFV would leave for us window lickers. TL;DR: Walter Mitty manages NEGATIVE ASSETS that GO MISSING and result in a WILD GOOSE CHASE. And remember, it may not moon today, it may not moon next week, it may not even moon this year, but whilst there is faith, the moon is ultimately inevitable. :firecracker::firecracker::firecracker::firecracker::chart_increasing::chart_increasing::chart_increasing::chart_increasing::gem_stone::gem_stone::gem_stone::gem_stone:	Spikyfreshpineapples	111	59	18

	1618511342.0	Not saving anything for the way back is then a kind of act of faith — a belief that if you dig deep enough, you’ll find a layer of black gold heretofore untapped. &#x200B; Second, it intimidates one’s enemies, who are terrified by the uncertainty of just how far you’ll go — just how much you’re willing to risk, to do without. “Hannibal’s will was broken,” Barton notes, “when he received news that the Romans were ‘discarding’ their soldiers at the moment they were most in need of them.” Take a game of chicken far enough, and a competitor will often give up and turn back. &#x200B; In some things in life, there are simply no guarantees. You have to push forward with all you have and make the most of the moment. You have to trust that even if you burn up so much fuel on the way out that you don’t have sufficient energy for the way back, you’ll have yet traveled far enough to have reached another shore. You won’t have to return to where you started. You’ll have opened a new possibility for your life. &#x200B; As Anton and Vincent swim through the ocean towards the horizon, the former, frightened by fatigue and how far out they’ve gotten, beseeches his brother: “We have to go back.” &#x200B; “It’s too late,” Vincent answers. “We’re closer to the other side.” &#x200B; All is the price of all..

	1618506694.0	News and information out of GameStop has been dropping left and right lately. I'm excited for more news that could drop today or through the end of the week. We can still expect the 2021 Meeting proxy documents, and an official press release from gamestop regarding the search for a CEO that Reuters reported. Gamestop is still operating with an interim CFO, so they may still announce a hire for that position. I wonder what other surprises are in store? ******** 8 April: [GameStop Announces Slate of Director Candidates for 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-slate-director-candidates-2021-annual-meeting) 12 April: [Reuters reports Gamestop is searching for a replacement for CEO ](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gamestop-ceo-exclusive/exclusive-gamestop-initiates-search-for-new-ceo-sources-idUSKBN2BZ290) 13 April: [GameStop Announces Voluntary Early Redemption of Senior Notes](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-voluntary-early-redemption-senior-notes-0) 14 April: [Gamestop SEC filings show forfeiture of 706,096 total shares by CEO Sherman and EVP/CMO Homeister for failing to meet performance goals.](https://news.gamestop.com/financial-information/sec-filings)	YouAreAPyrate	42210	14017	5

It creates a lot of energy: - Price will move little off that action, but it garnishes the attention of others - Having a big following sets the table for all to see - Seeing is believing; others will take notice and understand that DFV remains as bullish as they come - The trend will be to stick alongside this genius in the quest for never ending tendies - The HYPE is real! - This also sets a precedent for more buying and more action - More buying = higher volume spikes - ANY additional catalyst will pair with this fantastically - IF (and I don’t think it’s a big if) DFV bought additional shares, aside from those exercised, I think AH tomorrow pops off and sends us into the stratosphere next week Take all that with a grain of salt, but Friday will be BIGLY HUGE for GME bulls	robbb_24	9475	1	20

You can’t hold til moon like shares. If we stay low volume and in this price range, I’m hoping premiums come down this afternoon and get bought up to retain g-squeeze potential for the week.

I am in charge of seating. Please call out your number! 1. ⁠⁠⁠Ape scientist - 3 Boarded (2nd ape added so they can do peer review. 3rd ape added for fun!) 2. ⁠⁠⁠Ape doctor - 2 Boarded 3. ⁠⁠⁠Ape construction crew - 4 boarded (1 can do bodge jobs?!?) 4. ⁠⁠⁠Ape zoo keeper - Boarded 5. ⁠⁠⁠Ape teacher - boarded (New specialization added - Apeschool teacher -for the little ones) - 1 boarded 6. ⁠⁠⁠Ape janitorial (edit: Custodial crew) - 1 boarded 7. ⁠⁠⁠Ape food service - Boarded (and going bananas!) 8. ⁠⁠⁠Ape agriculture team - 2 apes boarded Specialist added - Ape, ""guy"" - 3 boarded Specialist added - Grass Master Ape - Boarded 9. ⁠⁠⁠Ape law enforcement - Replaced designation with Ape Kindness Facilitator (because apes no hurt apes) - boarded 10. ⁠⁠⁠Apetards - 3 Boarded ###Edit: new designations added.

We cannot all be apetards.* ###Update - Ape Law Enforcement not accounted for. Guys we cannot take off until all designations have been filled!! Nvm, Ape law enforcement has been replaced by Ape kindness facilitator because apes no hurt apes! ##More important update! I have been informed via indisputable evidence that the Roaring Kitty himself is watching us. I need to address the fact that I forgot to allocate him seating. I will arrange for priority seating and promptly perform sepuku once I have fulfilled my service to you all and HIM upon arrival to the moon. I would like to see the moon before I go. #I believe launch is delayed because not all apes have boarded. I also want to allocate extra seats for GME employees and other MVPs!

Your job is to be ready for either. Also, if you sell after an event (for Americans), you will likely owe short-term gains taxes, which will likely be a quarter to a third of your profits.

People began to gather around me, like a relic from some bygone era, and I couldn't bear the scrutiny so I fled. Anyway, I think it was bearish.	Javaphile	6534	495	12

	1618514853.0	OH NO! Back in the 150's...anyway...as I was saying, I live next to an older couple (early 60's) and they have a grandson who I'm convinced is the spawn of Satan himself. Not sure what this kid's parents do during the day, but they're always dropping him off next door. This child is the loudest, whiniest little bastard you could ever imagine. My fiancee and I both WFH and every day we have to listen to his screeching and moaning followed by his surprisingly loud grandmother singing nursery rhymes to try and calm him down. The constant exchange between these two is almost as pathetic than the hedgies ping-ponging their wash sales back and forth to try and drop the price of GME. In conclusion...I want to take a vote on how should I should handle this situation when my tendies comes in. Should I... A. Buy the house next door B. Pay somebody to kidnap the grandson C. Move into a mansion D. Offer the grandma $10,000 to let me punch her grandson whenever he misbehaves	GamecubeAdopter	9062	14122	24

	1618497668.0	Why im finally bullish again on GME? I’ve been bearish since the first peak and even when it jumped to 200 again but I am finally bullish on it for the sole reason it’s become a cultural phenomenon. It’s become so strong that I don’t think it can be left out of the conversation at this point and the more that’s being pushed forward the more the company pushes forward to give back to its fans. I really think this is bullish not just because of a squeeze but actually because of us	komoru-1	1490	2547	27
	1618522022.0	Well, once again that c o i n we don't talk about outside of the designated thread has gone insane and given me the gift of $ to buy GME. I now have a fuck ton of free money to blow on GME. Weeeeeeeee! I want a red Lambo.	nerdburg	32879	14089	26
	1618522360.0	I know the subject rules hasn't changed but i can relate it to GME. I was attempting to buy 1mil dodge for that $1 point and be a millionaire. I actually got close, with somewhere between 500k-750k at one point. I had paper hands back then, sold for only double profit. If i held like a true diamond handed ape. I could have $100k to throw at GME right now. Shame me now, please.	Psypho_Diaz	2442	1	23

I've been looking through life's [source code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ), and I see NO protections against a stock's value going higher than the maximum for a 32-bit integer.

I mean, they do know we'd love to finally enjoy some of the fruits of our efforts too? We've been :gem_stone::open_hands: loyal.

	1618505084.0	Ok... revisiting my reply post from 4/7: I've been watching the figures for a while. 4/16 was actually $115 about 2-3 weeks ago and has been creeping up. 4/23 is now at $187.50 from $160. 4/30 is at $165 up from $150. 5/7 is at $185 up from $175 - however there's very little activity on 5/7. As more and more Puts/calls are opened, the value changes on each week and not very quickly. I doubt they will push it down to $135 And now: 4/16: $150 4/23: $165 4/30: $160 5/7: $200 5/14: $170 Things are starting to move toward a consolidation in options. I don't know what this means, but my theory in that they are playing in 'max-pain' to hurt options holders and force most of them to expire out of the money.	PCBSD2	693	1	9

	1618554577.0	So I can’t view 4/16 options on Robinhood (I know I fucking suck). Normally people on RH can trade 0/1 DTE options. Today I can’t.. something is incredibly fucky. If premarket is up big I will be fucking furious, tried to buy 4/16 $200 calls and couldn’t near end of day. Scrambled to 4/23 to buy calls 30 seconds before close (Apple Watch is key near eod) and didn’t get anything filled in the scramble. I fear I missed out big. Will find out tomorrow morning.

Blessed is he who, in the name of the charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers.

As small beads of sweat dripped down his face, he stared at his screen. Red. Red. Red. His hysterical wife screamed at him, her bf whipped him over and over with his belt. Each day his madness grew but he refused to sell. Eventually he believed so much that he was right, he stole the bf's car, and drove as far as he could. He parked it under a bridge and kept updating ""Yahoo Finance"" on his phone. The car ran out of gas, and the bitter cold of the night took over. He should have froze to death but no one found his body. Just a cracked phone with 0 battery. They say whenever you refuse to sell a weekly call option with no hope, if you feel a chill on your back it might be the hand of the ol' ASO call holder coming to feast on your soul."	dw_eve	8486	129	4

	1618495133.0	"Thanks, Girls!!! Because reading ""To The Moon"", and the rest of the Ape circle jerk chants made me sad (it was like the time I called an uber and it was one of my wife's old boyfriends in a primered up Dodge Journey. He had crumbs in his beard and smelled like a Wendys), I went away for a while. Spent time with the family, stopped obsessing over the premarket, found out my kid's names, and eventually even started wearing pants. And you know what? My kids are idiots, their names are a waste of letters, and I'm afraid they could even be mine. My wife was so happy she got off TInder and wants to have sex with me which is fantastic because it's like a warm jar of mayonnaise in her pants and I have another half dozen std's now. So, yea,h thanks for driving me off WSB. GME to whatever forever, right? Just all GME, all the time in one room, my wife in the other with her legs spread like she's waiting for me to come in and dip a chicken wing in that crusty blue cheese snatch, and my mongoloid kids running around humping the furniture and trying to lick the cat. Awesome. Have fun at the circle jerk weetods, say high to the stonks. Oh, I forgot, they are gone too. Even the coke smells different these days. The word tendies, in print, makes me physically ill, I can't go outside at night because of the moon. This isn't like 4chan found a Bloomberg terminal, it's like Instagram found r/nkla Good Luck.

	1618495651.0	You know what’s really funny? So many apes here pretend to be confident GME will moon. Yet 99% of you are only holding stocks. Most of you don’t even know what options are. If you were all so confident, you would buy call options like DFV did. Like me, I’m confident GME will drop, so I get puts. But almost all of you have like a few hundred or less in shares and are hoping to get rich off of that. Pathetic lol. If you’re so confident, get calls and be billionaires instead of millionaires right? The truth is you all know deep down that GME is a trash company. Because if you were so confident, you would buy calls, ESPECIALLY after the stock has fallen 50% over the last month. If the stock was going to moon, right now calls would be considered on an ultra huge discount	consultinglove	16393	4287	-94

You're suggesting they would make money off of their hedge position? That means they lose more on their short position. They are SELLING options. When you buy a $200 or $800 option that expires worthless, that helps them, that doesn't hurt them. They are earning free premiums.	murmandamos	116779	468	8

I stress so much knowing that my paycheck is cut by 1/3 to give him money and I dont want him thinking he's a burden to me because he's not. He's diabetic and has a back injury from his work in construction so he needs the money I send to buy his medicine. I told him about my 17 shares in GME. He told me he doesn't understand it that well but he hopes I make money from it. He unintentionally memed me with the ""are you winning, son?""

	1618565311.0	Precisely, i think we see GME what it has been doing for the past few days, a very tiny fast meltup that sends options IV going bonkers and than a slow grind to burn theta out. People think that DFV exercising together at 50k shares is going to make such a difference that this will just melt up. I mean at GMEs massive rallies we saw volume upto millions of shares being traded, 50k shares is a tiny green candle on the 1 min for GME chart. Option exercising is not going to have an impact on the stock as his strike is $12, HF have already delta hedged his position and many others since this fiasco.	letspaintitallblack	3117	2551	13

	1618544008.0	Just keep finding 1 thing to keep you waking up in the morning. And remember, if it's worth doing, it's worth doing badly. Don't feel like brushing your teeth? Fine, swish some toothpaste around in your mouth. Don't feel like showering? At least run water through your hair. Don't feel like cooking? At least stuff a couple slices of bread down into your belly. Dark places fucking suck, and it's so easy to forget to take care of yourself. Keep waking up, at least do the bare minimum, and remember that this won't last forever. And all of it will be easier with more money in your pocket ;)	ducksflytogether_	20657	1608	10

When we graduated, the lucky among us got high paying jobs where they'd sit in one place for 8 hours and repeat the same tasks over and over. We have been given all the necessary tools to pull this off. Hell yes we were made for this shit, and we are a monster of their own creation.	grapefruitmixup	7234	19	1

Probably depends on how much cash you can afford to lose. Don’t hold options just because people here tell everyone to hold is my advice.

You don't really need to know the technicals - just if the pink line crosses the blue you'll get a dip. If the blue crosses the pink - you'll get a spike. This can help you time your trades.

	1618497650.0	Hedge funds are to revise the way they monitor risk after retail investors sent the price of stocks such as GameStop soaring — triggering big losses for the fund managers that bet against them. Investors co-ordinating their purchases on Reddit’s WallStreetBets message board were able to drive up the share price of Gamestop, the US video game retailer, from less than $20 at the start of the year to more than $480 by late January, while the prices of some other beaten-down stocks also soared. For some hedge funds, that proved painful. http://www.ft.com/cms/s/f7ddacb6-dc07-4142-adb2-f7eedf3a2272,s01=1.html?ftcamp=traffic/partner/feed_headline/us_yahoo/auddev&yptr=yahoo	Flat_Championship735	155	1	-1

	1618507886.0	Low volume can lead to price spikes. If there are not many buyers or sellers its harder to fill orders, works in both directions. People want to sell but nobody willing to buy price drops until they can fill orders and vice versa. Low volume also makes it much easier for hedge funds or market makers to manipulate the price.

The main winding was of the normal lotus-o-deltoid type placed in panendermic semi-boloid slots in the stator, every seventh conductor being connected by a nonreversible tremmie pipe to the differential girdlespring on the ""up"" end of the grammeters.*"	MarkusBerkel	13601	705	3

They need the price to drop so they can make money but they also need the price to rise so they can make money because there's pretty much no way their lowest shares aren't near where the prices we were just at barring some ITM options...

	1618496721.0	That’s what I tell people who ask about it. I hope to make money, but at the end of the day this is providing far more entertainment than anything money could buy right now. Similar to lottery tickets, best entrainment for the money! Spend $2 and get to dream about becoming a millionaire for a few nights. GME was $40 at one point and the entertainment has lasted months! There’s nothing that beats that entertainment value. Hell, going to the movies(if you’re allowed) costs almost $20 if you get food and drink. I tell people pick up one share purely for entertainment purposes because you can’t beat it. And it has the upside of making you money! You can’t make money going to the movies, sports game or amusement park.	Leiutendies	794	894	1

	1618522146.0	The likelihood of most people selling right now is low given the reason they bought was with high expectations for an exit point. If the numbers and figures being discussed are real we don't need a catalyst and it won't matter what anyone does for the next few months because the price is going to do what it's going to do without intervention by regulatory bodies. Just my opinion as one guy who's reading along.	artmagic95833	52611	871	7

In this way, I have made over £400 and, now that the complexity of the political situation affords greater scope, I shall begin all over again. It’s a type of operation that makes demands on one’s time, and it’s worth while running some risk in order to relieve the enemy of his money. Even Karl Marx was an ape.	grapefruitmixup	7235	19	2

If it's any consolation, a difference of 10 or 20 dollars each during a dip is just price semantics considering how volatile the price is and the potential of our return.	mythrilcrafter	11521	37	3
	1618497138.0	Watch the [MACD](https://imgur.com/AkBtzrt). See how the price and the lines on the bottom coincide? If you have convergence of the pink or blue lines, it indicates a shift. You don't really need to know the technicals - just if the pink line crosses the blue you'll get a dip. If the blue crosses the pink - you'll get a spike. This can help you time your trades.	nerdburg	32880	14089	1

	1618522592.0	Read about the Panic of 1902. That's basically what happened. They ended up merging into a single company that was later torn apart for violating the anti-trust rules for existing. The realest answer is if it goes too far (no idea what point that really is) I expect the gov't would step in and negotiate a settlement or something. I also think the markets would shut down first. GME may even have a 30 day trading halt. The real answer is nobody knows but this are my best guesses. Do not trust me, I'm a member of the internet.

	1618521336.0	Well technically the price can't rise without anyone paying that new price. And for someone to be able to buy at a certain price, someone has to be willing to sell at that price. So it can't moon if no one sells. Yes it's driven by buyers demand but someone has to start selling and then others pile on at an ever increasing price for it to jump in prices.

	1618517130.0	Well first of all, money isn't real, but since you're worried about it I'd like to point out that this isnt really even a big swing for GME, pretty normal activity honestly. Secondly, the company literally paid off all of its debt, so theres no way in hell its going to 0, plus the long term upside of their transformation is huge. If you're worried about a measly 6% drop in one of the most highly volatile stocks right now idk what to tell you friend	themapmvp	2664	1506	2

	1618486893.0	Currently the stock has broken out well above its fundamentals, many institutions invest based on technical analysis & fundamentals; meaning they're likely to go short on GME since in theory, it's well above its price point. However, other hedgies/institutions and retail whales are doing exactly the opposite because GME is a once in a lifetime sorta deal, this doesn't happen often!	EridTV	5082	4356	4
	1618486699.0	They don’t have to post their full short position but, don’t let GMEheads hear you say that. I’m still holding as well btw.

Ethan Hawke, Jude Law & Uma Thurman - all about genetic superiority/inferiority, nature vs. nurture, societal control/standards/expectation, etc. Great movie! Edit: I also just realized that Ethan Hawke's character is deemed genetically inferior (autist) but he had the goal to be an astronaut! Fitting movie!!!	missktnyc	2799	81	2

	1618510208.0	Started my transfer yesterday!

My transfer is still pending, but I'm pretty sure it will go through by Friday or Monday.	Oktocry	717	1392	2
	1618510216.0	Better idea. Keep ur shares in RH until the squeeze. Meanwhile fund your fidelity account just in case u need to buy more. Don’t give those fucking crooks the $75 transfer fee	Gigidypaperhands	1290	2867	1

	1618535096.0	You know, this is something I haven’t really thought about. April 16 options would have been the only thing on the table in December and January. Think about the crowd that got in early with calls. Like sub $100 strike price crowd that haven’t sold.

	1618535181.0	I personally think it won’t, but my reasoning for why it COULD would be increased faith.

	1618535205.0	Because those shares would have been hedged (set aside) long ago. Or if some broker really waited a whole year to get surprised now, then they had better be able to provide those shares now at the current price.	C141Clay	22166	577	3
	1618535251.0	The explanation I've seen most is that those should all be hedged (bought up) by now. DFV exercising his options is him buying the shares that someone else already bought at the agreed upon price	Constitutional_Prole	11402	7220	3

	1618516817.0	The DD remains the same. Unless they can crash it to sub $20 (and they can't, how many of us drool at the thought of buying so many shares at that price?) then if we hold the real shares, eventually they'll run out of money to pay the interest on the shorts. The only sad thing is that the longer it goes on, the worse the ripple on the rest of the market. When we finally get paid, the entire economy gonna crater. Not financial advice.

	1618515873.0	"No big words needed. Supply and demand. When we buy we limit supply. When people with shorts have to buy to cover, demand goes up with limited supply. This means the price to cover starts to take off quickly. Of course there is devil in the details, but that is the top line. Another thing that happens is when a share is borrowed to short, it is not like buying and holding. You can't just sit on it. Like borrowing everything else, interest is charged against it. This is how the institution taking the bet makes money or hedges their losses. However, some over extend and short more shares than are available. This is a naked short. This can really shoot the price up because now they have shorted beyond what can be purchased and if there is a large portion of naked shorts in the market looking to cover, this is the moon shot. Back to the interest, so as time goes on the gap to drop to make money increases. You can imagine then if you shorted at say $40 and the price is up to $200, and daily you get charged money to hold onto your position... it becomes like the national debt. You and I may take a short for a couple of hundred or thousands of dollars. They take shorts in the millions so the daily interest penalty is significant. There is a lot more to it than this. I am trying to give it to you in a way that starts the gears turning. I suggest you do more reading and learn the ins and outs of short sells. &#x200B; EDIT: So the borrow called margin instead of a loan. They institution that hold your bet will only allow you to be at a loss up to waht you can cover financially. If it starts to get close, you will get ""Margin Called"" where they force you to buy and hand the shares over, or at least the monetary value. This is the squeezze... you squeeze people out of their position. &#x200B; Max pain is when we draw this out by holding, keeping the price up, they are racking up interest with no way out. Our plan is to force the shorts into a squeeze."	Kirder54	3838	42	2

So ostensibly they can short for as long as shares aren't recalled, because when they are, suddenly Melvin and anyone else who has been synthesizing shares has to find a share to give to whoever they got it on loan from.

And a dump that massive usually tanks the price into circuit breaking territory, but here we have more buyers than sellers, the price rises, those shorters begin to worry and start buying to cover to hedge what might be massive losses, long term shorters do the same, and bam, we're off. could happen tomorrow, could happen next month.

You know who owns lots of options? People who needed to buy them to reset FTDs and huge short positions. That's who. We will hover around 150 all day and that is a good thing for us. ""Red bad, green good"" is such an ape-unworthy simpleminded approach to this. Grow some wrinkles for gods sake. Do you want $200 as a price today if that helps shorts by letting them make a shitload of money on options? If you're saying yes then you're seriously almost a real ape. **Smart apes know that to win the war you don't have to win every battle.

	1618550194.0	Nothing happens except DFV gets insanely rich! The shares were already purchased by the MM to hedge those contracts.

	1618572283.0	I believe that it depends on the broker. They will generally sell the contract if you can't afford to pay for the shares. If you do have enough money I believe that they will generally exercise at/around close unless you specify otherwise.	happysheeple3	10985	208	3

	1618506389.0	You’re going to get downvoted but the short is answer is they havnt covered and the people who say they have are the media who are payed for and boomers who can’t see the full picture. it’s next too impossible for them too of covered, they’d be bankrupt by now.They’re just kicking the can down the road	thiccnmoist	1802	10	2
	1618506494.0	It doesn't matter, because they can do this thing called 'Failure to Deliver' and pay like 0.03 instead of buy a share for $170. Why would they do this? It's cheaper, and the last thing they would ever do is buy an over-priced stock making it go up. So they will instead have like 1B failure to deliver's screwing all of the apes here in this sub.	tommygunz007	178879	33115	2

	1618506514.0	>Serious question: some people say Hedgies have to cover, and others say they already have. WTF is the truth? If tye HF covered, I gotta ask, how TF did they cover billions in losses? They almost certainly repositioned their shorts to be much higher. It's easy enough to cover one short position and then reopen it at say $280+ when the share prices were that high. They won't get margin called on those unless the price skyrockets which it wont do naturally.	Thelastret2	1365	69	1

	1618529288.0	If it turns out that all the DD on the short squeeze was wrong, or if it was right but the squeeze didn't happen because of institutional fuckery, I won't be mad at all. The long term value play is still going on. Everything we've seen in the past months with Cohen points in a positive direction. This is a company that will make a massive turnaround into e-commerce, and it has the benefits of already having a world wide presence and a loyal customer base. Either way I'm gonna be making money. If it squeezes to 10k/100k/1000k I'll profit, if it goes to 300 on fundamentals I'll make hella profits too. No stress brother.

	1618522093.0	Signs of being in a cult The group is preoccupied with making money. Questioning, doubt, and dissent are discouraged or even punished. Mind-numbing techniques (such as meditation, chanting, speaking in tongues, denunciation sessions, debilitating work routines) are used to suppress doubts about the group and its leader(s). The leadership dictates sometimes in great detail how members should think, act, and feel (for example: members must get permission from leaders to date, change jobs, get married; leaders may prescribe what types of clothes to wear, where to live, how to discipline children, and so forth). The group is elitist, claiming a special, exalted status for itself, its leader(s), and members (for example: the leader is considered the Messiah or an avatar; the group and/or the leader has a special mission to save humanity). The group has a polarized us- versus-them mentality, which causes conflict with the wider society. The leadership induces guilt feelings in members in order to control them. Members' subservience to the group causes them to cut ties with family and friends, and to give up personal goals and activities that were of interest before joining the group.	ingrown_urethra	9037	10506	1

	1618500307.0	I think you’re asking a lot of difficult questions. I haven’t invested in GME but I also haven’t seen anything that’s solid proof that there will be another squeeze. I think the majority of people got in post squeeze which is why they’re so reluctant to hear there won’t be another and will heavily downvote anyone who even implies it. There used to be DDs giving definitive dates and those dates would come and nothing would happen. No one has addressed this. Rumours would go around that Cohen would become CEO and everyone would hurray about how this was fantastic news but had the same reaction when it came out that he probably won’t be. The majority have to believe there’ll be another squeeze cause hoping for something feels good.	husthet	3079	1505	6

There is no point in stressing about the price, trust me I've been doing it a lot, and just had to shut down my attention to GME for my own mental health. I believe in the company, and now by year's end the price will be much higher regardless of a squeeze or not.	mundane_marietta	26056	538	1

	1618522217.0	Signs your in a cult. Check #2 and #3 The group is preoccupied with making money. Questioning, doubt, and dissent are discouraged or even punished. Mind-numbing techniques (such as meditation, chanting, speaking in tongues, denunciation sessions, debilitating work routines) are used to suppress doubts about the group and its leader(s). The leadership dictates sometimes in great detail how members should think, act, and feel (for example: members must get permission from leaders to date, change jobs, get married; leaders may prescribe what types of clothes to wear, where to live, how to discipline children, and so forth). The group is elitist, claiming a special, exalted status for itself, its leader(s), and members (for example: the leader is considered the Messiah or an avatar; the group and/or the leader has a special mission to save humanity). The group has a polarized us- versus-them mentality, which causes conflict with the wider society. The leadership induces guilt feelings in members in order to control them. Members' subservience to the group causes them to cut ties with family and friends, and to give up personal goals and activities that were of interest before joining the group.	ingrown_urethra	9037	10506	1

I do both; typically limit orders for big drops but I also buy at market rate if I feel like it. I don’t think it really matters which you do, or in the bigger picture I doubt it makes a difference to the overall price.	keef-keefson	452	20	1

	1618497707.0	People who have shorted the stock (borrowed someone else's and sold it) can be placed into a forced-purchase situation by margin call -- they lack enough cash reserves to recover the shares they've shorted -- and the shares are then bought for them, regardless of current price, by regulation. This can have a domino effect where those forced purchases cause additional margin calls by increasing the price.	forzan	3009	7344	1

	1618510348.0	Its only 50,000 shares, which is a drop in the bucket for volume and if the broker isnt a complete idiot, they hedged those shares a long fucking time ago. Him exercising will have 0 effect. Those things have been in the money for like 3-4 months.	TheBonusWings	6560	11098	1

I’m not on “it’ll be worth a million” but when a catalyst happens like a recall, it’s going to squeeze. I’m a doubter and even I see the math for something big, but it’s not going to randomly happen.

	1618504691.0	Sadly, it is just information - that this stock is manipulated. As for benefits to apes, I don't know - if the shorts are writing them, then it's massive income, enough to punt this train wreck further. If the longs are writing them, then they are just stealing money from buyers (I'd think many retail) while they decide when to launch the rocket (for themselves). Be realistic, no one is for apes winning. It just happens that apes are on the long side.	hey-mr-broke	5437	8	1

	1618544135.0	It’s safe to assume that a lot of those contracts are naked . If they go in the money it forces them to buy hard to get shares to cover (100 shares per contract). Which drives the price up which puts the next tier in the money which they then have to cover. And so on. A gamma squeeze. When we rocketed the first time the entire option chain was in the money by over 200 dollars. That’s why brokers limited our ability to buy. It can happen again.	futuristanon	6488	1	3

	1618498350.0	I don't want to spread FUD about the whole thing, but I emailed RH support with: *I have a question. I’m holding a volatile stock on robinhood, would there ever be an instance where the app would keep me from selling? Similar to how it kept people from purchasing stock in January? I’ve been looking at other brokers that have no such stain but would forego moving if I had peace of mind.* They responded with: *That is really hard to foresee. I've been in the industry 15 years and worked for 2 very large brokerages and I have seen halting done on various securities. Plus I have seen the exchanges halt which there is nothing any broker can do.* Which instilled ZERO confidence. They're already talking like it's a possibility so they can cover their asses. If it gets bad enough, I could see them forcing shit on their users to stay alive and fight lawsuits later. If you transfer to Fidelity it should be easy. I had a couple options which caused RH to reject my transfer without even notifying me. It wasn't until I followed up to see what was taking so long that they told me my transfer was rejected.

Took about there days and a phone call to switch to a cash account, but it was worth it. Highly recommend getting out of there. They also 'punish"" you if you transfer your whole portfolio.

	1618534108.0	Sorry if this is a basic ass question, but I think it’s finally coming together for me lol The float is the 70 million share total minus insiders right? So when the Bloomberg terminal data shows that institutions own 142% of the float, do the retail holders factor into that number as well? Because I’ve seen people say that retail is counted separate from the institutions. If that’s true, then they really need to buy back like 10x the shares that exist huh?

	1618520756.0	anyone who got out that fast got right back in again \*edit: anyone who opened shorts above 200 and is out now is daytrading and is definitely back in. Anyone who got in at 200 and held short positions is obviously still in, so the bottom line is that at any given moment GME is shorted to levels easily 30-50% of float, and a sudden rise that doesn't relent much or hopefuly at all - catches even daytrading shorters with their pants down.	deca-d	9663	4969	3

Like a true autist, I bought mine during a peak so I still need a 20% or so shift for it to be good.

	1618522723.0	Don’t ask such questions fren. We are a cult after all. I’ll dm you a good counter DD if you really want a different perspective on things though.	ttwbb	8821	1600	2
	1618524178.0	Ask yourself a few questions. Does it feel like this stock is acting behaving normally. Have you seen it being manipulated in the dark pool market (buy off market, sell public)? Have you seen Melvin's losses? Why is the mainstream media not reporting honestly? Why do the HFs continue to short? Why is DFV still holding when he could have cashed out for millions upon millions? I'm going to stop because you don't like to read and I don't like to write. Read the DD.	Pawl_Rt	4935	1125	2
	1618523287.0	Because they are opening more shorts each and every day trying to control the price, especially watch the Friday volumes and remind yourself that there supposed to be only 50 million total shares	meno22	2057	1	1
	1618523334.0	Official reports of the SI are self reported or in other words untrustworthy and the last bloomberg terminal drop showed institutional ownership alone at 130 some percent. So surely its inevitable?	dnb4eva1210	3556	312	1
	1618523482.0	It is absolutely not happening next year. There is no way. GameStop cannot have that many shorts by then or else the company wouldn’t be able to maximize their potential.	ilovewoofles123	1338	202	1
	1618526740.0	Institutions are only obliged to report long positions, not shorts. DD’s used SI at the start because it was so high, transparent institutions were going short, but major HFs who don’t give a fuck weren’t declaring. Then the Bloomberg screenshots came out and we found out how fucked Citadel and Melvin was, then they said they doubled down. If they were covering bit by bit, we’d see a bit by bit price increase, but why would they do this knowing the amount of interest they are paying on Failed To Deliver contracts? Realistically they want to cover at low prices like they did 2nd squeeze, but the low volume just shows how hard we’re holding, and that this $140-150 bracket may just be the new $40-50 bracket.

	1618509605.0	The 50,000 shares from his calls may not directly impact the price, sure. But the announcement of him exercising it may have even the slightest effect (similar to when he doubled down back at $38) I theorize that it may not be enough to change anything alone, but doing so ON TOP of already high volume may give it more fuel	natetrillo	839	113	1

	1618510263.0	Exercising his options won’t have any effect on the stock price because whoever sold them to him hedged the calls a long time ago. The 100,000+ volume when the price jumped up was from someone buying shares (or maybe someone hedging new purchased options?).	No_Locksmith6444	2207	6	1

	1618527884.0	I know 46k on it’s own isn’t much to move the needle but I’m thinking of the aftershock of seeing a DFV update where he chose to do that signifying that he thinks this is still a bargain price and anyone looking at level 2 data seeing a buy order that large triggering FOMO or something. 46k is a lot to happen all at once	mcj1ggl3	17322	1185	1

	1618536716.0	DFV bought a contract that allows him to buy shares at $12 bucks I think. If he exercises he gets to buy them at $12. Or, he can sell the options back to the MM at the current price. The MM has already purchased shares and balanced others' sold contracts to remain hedged. If DFV sells the contracts back, the MMs shares will be sold at market to pay him off. Given the millions of shares that trade each day, the selling of the hedged shares will likely have little impact to current shareholders.	Quantity_Weary	3115	129	2

	1618505525.0	Max pain went up again and is at 150 now, but yes it did go down for next week. But there are a lot more calls expiring this week than next week (like 10x more). If I were one of the people buying those OTM calls, I would definitely be applying some volume to try to get them ITM at some point today or tomorrow. But there also about 2.5x more puts expiring tomorrow than calls, so I guess driving the price down as much as possible makes even more sense. I'm just surprised we aren't seeing more volume to move it one way or the other.	Juker57	3797	238	1

	1618516135.0	A call option is “in the money” when share price goes above the strike price and can also be exercised. Calls are a bit like being “long” with options, expecting the price to go above your prediction, while Puts are like shorts, you expect price to go under your strike price. Here DFV bought, god knows how many months ago, calls at a 12$ strike price, let’s say he’s deeeeeep in the money. He didn’t sell when we were at highs, so I think most of us are expecting he’ll exercise them. (Buying each 100 shares per call... that’s 50,000 shares he can get, by buying them at 12$ each)	Lagviper	6059	1	2

You can transfer some shares at a time so that not *all* your shares will be locked mid-squoze. After all, if the ""Exit Strategy"" DD is followed, you won't be selling all your shares at one shot, but spread out over the duration of the squeeze. So it's not like you'll need 100% of your shares unlocked at all times. Just a thought."	Roguenul	1344	3	3

Anyways, the numbers in the middle are bud/ask prices or what someone is willing to buy or sell for. It’s rare to have the same number of shares at each different price. Them all being 25 shares are very obviously set up to create a cascade of sells. It’s a manipulation tactic. Just hold. This price isn’t real. It’s artificial.

	1618509579.0	There's nothing wrong with a stock split. It means more shares, but it doesn't benefit shorters, if anything it makes the problem worse. Say GME is at $200 when a 5-1 stock split occurs. For every 1 share out there at $200, there are now 5 shares at $40. This doesn't improve the short position at all, since now they also need to buyback 5x more shares. The lower price point also makes it difficult for them because now retail can afford to push the movement again. A stock split is a death sentence for shorts.	JohnnyMagicTOG	10980	421	2

	1618495045.0	Rh admitted that anything you buy through them you don’t actually own. They expect you to lose money so they essentially don’t waste their time filling your order and give you an iou for if you actually make money. They couldn’t handle GME when it was $450 and got margin called for 3billion because they never actually bought the shares they owed to people like you and me. And they’re potentially making it worse for themselves by continuing to lend out margin accounts to hedge funds. So if they couldn’t handle GME at 450 they surely won’t be able to handle it at 1000+.

	1618513667.0	My thoughts on it are: * short to make it look like a crash * Gauge the selling pressure because you know exactly how much you sold. If they see none they begin to cover at the now depressed price. * return shares you just borrowed and try again tomorrow? * they know we will buy the dips with enough time so they don't want to strengthen our numbers, if the fear wasn't created and no paper hands they recognize the pending issue. They dug the hole deeper. * maybe it's a way to check sentiment. I know I maybe missing something but it almost seems like the safest play they can make at this point. Either way thank you for the input.	c4939	6414	2815	1

	1618499485.0	Ok I understand that step of it but what if they just... don’t?

	1618499766.0	I know they *have* to, I am not saying they have a choice legally, but realistically they could just not press the button to pay it and I want to know what happens then, what sort of sanctions and steps will be taken to enforce it	Fit-Limit-2626	3484	494	1
	1618499525.0	Yes and what if they don’t? Would it help if I also wrote in capitals?	Fit-Limit-2626	3484	494	3
	1618499661.0	Yeah I know that. But I *have* to pay my mortgage every month. But I know my bank has plans for if I don’t. What is that backup plan? It’s no use just saying “but they have to” I want to know what happens if they don’t do it anyway.	Fit-Limit-2626	3484	494	3

	1618530707.0	Yeah this is the biggest learning point to be honest. Everythings fucked man. Those with money have the power to direct the news in any way they want to, summon thousands of online accounts, and tell the brokers what to do. There's no way the Robinhood shit was actually due to liquidity issues. There's no way any reasonable press would portray gains and losses like these fucks have been doing. There's no way a hedge fund would pay money to spread the news they've covered a position, they'd just shut up and earn back their money. It's all rigged man. But I don't give a fuck tho. Either way I'll make money. Fuck all of it, this company is doing great. New leadership, no debts, global reach.

	1618493320.0	Let's see, since you can't just giggle and move one. First, he live in the US and I would venture to guess 99.9% of his driving is done here in America. Second, generally such behavior is really frowned upon in other countries like the UK, that being having poor driving skills and etiquette where here people get to be assholes on the road because the POPO won't enforce such things. Which is why us folks here in the US talk about such nonsense driving us crazy. 3rd, I would image when he travels internationally, like most people, they tend to use public transportation and taxi services more often than not sue to lack of familiarity with their area, lack of familiarity with laws... and a lot do not have international drivers licenses.

	1618517282.0	I did word it badly because I don't know how to explain the concern well. Let me try again. That former CEO's shares go back to GME, so they have more shares to sell. DFV executes his options buying more shares. GME has shares to sell, the hedges and MM's need them to cover the over shorted positions, is there enough for everyone? If there isn't who get's priority of order filled, DFV or hedges needing to dig out? Could this result in a lot of failure-to-deliver's and get a whole lot more trouble on the MM's?

	1618553214.0	Seconded. GME is overall a good play. They are in good hands having hired Cohen’s executive associates from Chewy and Amazon. The digital transformation is a very real possibility and like many I believe in the stock. Looking at their recent filings they are making several strategic moves to increase capital like increasing dilution amount to $1B, forcing the forfeiture of the CEO’s ~500K+ shares, and also paying off their debt ahead of schedule, which can allow them sell some of the retail stores, reducing overhead costs, and flipping properties for even more capital. One way or another good things are coming for GME. The HF’s who shorted GameStop thought they would short it into oblivion, hoping it would go bankrupt. That is now completely off the table. **It is only up from here.** **$GME to the MOON** :gem_stone::raising_hands:	Glowingfirechild	5951	17	1

	1618518654.0	You don't pay the interest rate up front, you may or may not pay a borrower fee (usually a compensation cost for volatile shares). You pay the interest rate during the loan term, and upon closing you pay the share borrowed back. If you can't pay the share back at the price you borrowed it, you buy it out of pocket, eating a loss on the share, plus a loss on all the interest you paid in the interm of the loan, plus any lender fees (collateral/compensation) that you pay at time of borrowing. So they don't need to nickel and dime you up front, since they going to get the bulk of their earnings with the high interest rates you will pay over the loan term.	ElleRisalo	67811	182	1

	1618511881.0	No they can only make retail buy orders not effect the price by placing them in the unseen market and the ones where the seller dropped down go into the market so the price is artificial. They can't cover shorts but can manipulate price through this method	RothIRAGambler	743	42	1
	1618512144.0	It's never realized because the order went through but just not in any market we have the ability to see. The SEC put out a new ruling that makes it so a trader must make 390+ trades a year atleast to have their trades palced on the dark pool (since the original design is for big market players and huge orders that could effect price to rocket up from fomo or shoot down due to a panic sell mentality) and most retail doesn't have that. Only problem is the rule has 45 days to be commented on by the SEC before being effective unless they approve it early	RothIRAGambler	743	42	1

	1618534470.0	Correct! I have a decent library of stuff that isn’t available to stream as well and plex provides a way to stream it from my home computer through their app to my phone, other computers, my tv, etc. It is a lot easier than I thought to set up - basically just install their program on the computer with all your music files and as long as you’re connected to the internet you can listen to them. It will also automatically scrape the metadata for your music as long as the files are organized, although you can also edit or add your own album art, details, etc. and, of course, it’s got a nice user interface so it’s not like you’re just scrolling through a big file list. I’ve been using it for about a year and am really digging it.	MissCityDump	508	25	2

	1618502006.0	Fidelity is good. You dont get a real time pretty app to check the price quickly.

	1618513375.0	Oh yeah that 2:01 and 2:02 spike. I'm west coast too, but didnt even think of it lol. I think that's way way way way more volume than DFV could be responsible for. Over a quarter-million volume in 2 minutes is pretty nice to see though.	margananagram	18341	700	1

	1618500115.0	“they” aren’t doing shit. There is this delightful thing call the DTCC... when they come knocking asking for owed shares... they literally start selling everything you have to pay for it. All their positions (other shares) get sold to pay for GME, when they run out of everything and go under, their bank+clearing housing, and finally the DTCC all end up paying. Its the MOASS, its like domino effect, autoliquidation is going to slap the market like a goddamn pimp. There is no “refusing” to pay, the DTCC simply starts selling the hegdies assets. They can’t not pay. Like the mother of all bank repos, everything is gonna get sold to pay their debt.	sknnbones	83273	6961	2

	1618529285.0	It is possible for a company to hide its shorts balance by hiding the position through synthetic long calls (buy option). There is an article where the SEC acknowledge this risk. The short interest are based on the “risk” of shorting a share, for example a larger amount of “I owe you” than the amount of supplies should raise some alarms and increase the interest rate (fuck I owe 100 banana but I can only buy 50 banana, how am I going to give those 50 extra banana to my customers ?!). But, it would be true in a transparent world where everyone play lawfully and disclose their trade position. At the moment you can just lie about how much you owe while the regulator is praying that you are telling the truth and maybe, sometimes, charge you for half a banana skin he spotted your lie.

I’m in a perfectly fine mood just typing whatever bullshit that comes to mind. I’m waiting at work and chose to waste time on Reddit. Does it make you feel better imagining I’m upset? If something irritates me here I just screenshot it and send it to my friends’ group chat. Doesn’t affect my mood negatively at all. Cheers!	NotSoSlenderMan	129747	1330	1

	1618503428.0	Noone actually believes a million a share it's banter. The price can still go very high, however it's also important to note that peak price != average cover price if you want to calculate the total cost. Furthermore there's insurers, brokers, agencies all on the line to cover this in turn, don't underestimate just how much wealth there is out there.	7Thommo7	38418	37	2
	1618501091.0	Blackrock manages 9T in assets. There is a realistic chance that the entire market bleeds out for weeks when GME goes to the moon, as not only are shorts forced to cover, but previously disinterested parties are forced to dump their positions and get in on GME being the only winning stock.

	1618502118.0	If they destabilize the market and don't support the clearing houses the entire economy will fail. The clearing houses are so deep in bed with the government that they might as well be the same entity. Pretty sure citadel or Blackrock (I'm reading too much DD lately forgive me) is heavily heavily invested in treasury bonds and their investment is what paid for the stimulus that went out. It's going to be a shit show, but the government not covering would be way more catastrophic.	Andyman0110	1953	1	1
	1618502864.0	The idea behind the 1MM a share thing is that the DTCC is insured up to 62T. The issue is that no insurance company in the world would actually pay that claim. And shorts don't actually have to buy up every individual share to unwind	SorosBuxlaundromat	2981	1	2
	1618502448.0	I still believe the SI is over 100% of float, but even if that weren't true officially its around 40%. 40% SI is insanely high. I think 1k per share at the peak is realistic, 5k seems like pure fantasy anything above that is just delusion. Imo. Ignore all dates. No one knows shit.

I'm fortunate to have almost 10k into it and at the time it was about the money. The more I observe and learn about the tactics the media and others are using to try and fold us apes gives me the determination to contribute as much as I comfortably can and prove them wrong. Make them understand that there are consequences to their dirty and greedy actions. They will take advantage of anyone, their own families, bankrupt companies, just for a little bit of money and feel no remorse about it. It's time we make them fear and give them the karma they so very much deserve.	CaregiverSpecific221	336	702	2

Like the short sellers. I didn't want to help those losers, so that's why I transferred out. As long as you don't transfer your entire portfolio, you can still trade your crypto:) A cash account keeps your shares as yours, and they cannot be borrowed by shorters. There's no option on casual6 to not be on margin, as far as I could tell.	SurpriseBananaSpider	27179	1104	2

	1618550876.0	"Short squeeze 101: to answer your question - yes and no. IF we didn't sell our shares back when they buy-to-cover, yes, that is literally the short squeeze. But right now us apes don't control enough shares - there's tons of institutions that will sell. But, for those not quite understanding - at the start of the process, no one ever sell shares to shorters - shares are lended to them. Right now, any broker will lend you, or anyone, shares for shorters to then immediately sell at market price. That is the first half of shorting (step 1) - shorters borrow a share at market price. Then, if the price falls, they buy a share - that's the second part that closes the loop - (step 2, which is what i think you're referring to.) And because these shorters already sold a share (earlier, that was step 1) and pocketed that money immediately, their (step 2) purchase of the share repays the borrowed share, and they keep the difference - IF the price falls. And the price usually falls when lended shares are dumped, because there are not enough buyers. So, the key to a short squeeze is the first step - us (squeezers) purchasing these borrowed shares when they become available, and holding them. Because now we might own more shares than even exist in the world, and the price didn't drop when the shares were sold. (Hell, technically, you could be buying a share that you owned that your broker lended out, so now you own a lended share and a real share, both of which are now real via the process of your purchase - your broker makes the share real when it brokers the transaction.) So, now, the shorters are fucked, because the price went up when you bought the lended/shorted share, not down, AND we own more float, so much float that it's possible us assholes own more shares than exist, meaning the shorters have less than zero shares available on the market to purchase (step 2) when they're looking to close the loop, leaving the ""infinity"" price tag theoretically (but obviously not practically) possible."	deca-d	9663	4969	2

	1618514565.0	i mean i think the price will prob go up organically sure but they can just reposition their shorts again by closing one and reopening another. All the people saying the short interest is 200% - 900% are conspiracy theory sounding and not evidence based. That said institutional holders, day traders using the volatility for profit and lets face it retail holders will sell well before it gets to $1000. Its going to be a long road before this goes up significantly. I am going to sell 80% of my position as soon as it rises appreciably rather than wait for some mythical MOASS that I don't think will happen. I believe I can make more money on other stocks.

Hedge funds have made a lot of money why fud them? (oh that's right, this subreddit told you to, and like a true sheep you fell in line) the fud comes from this sub sucking more dick than your mom. and the fact that it didn't always be r/all2.0 in here. Ppl think it's cool to gamble on the market. not because they like it. but because this forum tells them it's cool. haha look mom I go in that subreddit and talk about my wife's boyfriend and they're doing a story about us apes (lulz) on CNN!

	1618522013.0	Its because I am trying to sell you a product essentially. If I lent you a share, your sell point is 100% of your value, if I charge you 20% of the initial lending value a week, this means you have 5 weeks to pay me back my share or you lose money just to the interest. You would probably not like that to much in a volatile stock so say nah ill go elsewhere. If I instead said ill give it to you at 2%, you now have 50 weeks to pay me back, which is a way better position for you to have, and you'll say, a year to sit on it before I start losing...sign me up. I as the lender don't care, because I am going to get my initial investment back (the share) plus which ever % interest I tacked on to it. If I make it to high no one will ever borrow from me, thus im stuck with a share that isn't generating value....if I make it lower, you will borrow, and my share is now making me money, on top of technically still being an asset I can call my own. That is why rates haven't gone up to match scarcity, because if they do, no one will borrow anymore	ElleRisalo	67812	182	1

	1618502110.0	Here’s my honest opinion. Me personally i was debating back and forth should i do it or not do it. I said that to myself for over a month. In that month i could have transferred 15 different times and still would have been fine. It’s your choice to bite the bullet and go through with it or wait it out and hope. I bit the bullet and now I’m much happier with fidelity and feel like my funds are safe. Also, make sure your RH account is a CASH account before making the move as i believe it speeds up the process. To do this, go to your trade settings and scroll all the way down to day trade settings. Once in the day trader settings scroll all the way to the bottom and turn off instant settlement. This is the setting that shows your account as margin or cash. If your account is margin, your shares are able to be lent out to people shorting the stock (hedgefucks). Hopefully this helps you make a decision, see you on the moon ape :gorilla:	ThanksGamestop	5343	1454	5

	1618563129.0	A 10:1 split will give you 10 shares for every share you currently have, and divide the share price by 10. So if you have 25 shares, you will get 250 shares after the split. If they were valued at $150 a share on the day of the split, they would then be valued at $15 a share. This dramatically reopens the option market again, which is based around blocks of 100 shares. So at the moment to buy a $200 call with 6 months expiry would cost you $5,500, and to exercise it would cost $20,000. A 10:1 split would reduce that premium cost to $550, and exercise down to $2000. MUCH more reasonable. And if you have millions of dollars you can just buy 10 options instead, but you can't buy a fraction of an option.	Wholistic	19329	68	1

I watch Webull's ticker/level 2 information because while Fidelity is very trustworthy, it's such a boomer app lol. Good luck to you! Wait for a tasty dip, if possible, round up to an even 2 shares, and move those to Fidelity. Then call Fidelity because when you transfer margin accounts, they enter Fidelity as margin accounts. You'll want to change to a cash account. Their customer service is great! I hope you can do this. You deserve better than Cashapp. Took me about a month to realize that it just wasn't a great trading platform. There's actually a Cashapp subreddit and one of the top posts explains why you shouldn't use it for investing/trading. So I'd recommend you check that out.

	1618528594.0	This isn't how it works at all. The interest rates are annualized. A 2% interest rate costs you share price x .02 / 365 per day. Plus, the interest is at the current share price per day, not the price it was shorted at. Also, brokers set the interest rates, not shareholders. As brokers receive a cut of the lending fee, they are incentivized to set the highest rate possible, while still having a market to lend the share. >That is why rates haven't gone up to match scarcity, because if they do, no one will borrow anymore That doesn't make any sense. If no one will borrow if interest rates increase, that by definition means there is low demand and thus no scarcity as long as there is sufficient supply. If there is scarcity, that means demand exceeds supply, and thus interest rates will rise until the two are relatively equal. That is why borrow rates are a very good indicator of shares available to short. The low rate indicates the supply of shares available to lend exceeds demand for borrowing (i.e. demand to short). I just don't understand how there is a huge short interest when there are plenty of shares available to short at very reasonable borrow fees.	TheGunStays	12663	1788	1

	1618527250.0	That’s fair. I however believe the change in leadership will lead Gamestop into the next big e-commerce (sorry, I’ll say it anyways) giant. Not to mention they brought (and keep bringing) in ex Amazon/Chewy higher-ups/execs and their chairman turned dog food and toys into a multibillion dollar company. I don’t think any of them would be on board if Gamestop was the “failing” brick and mortar store some people thought it was. The fact that they paid off their debt during a pandemic two years before it was due tells me they are doing very well financially, and it can only get better from there. For the record I’m not one of those retards that think it will reach 10 million or whatever. I do however believe there is a big squeeze coming, and I don’t believe the stock will ever go back below $100.	BestComparison-	8743	7	1

I'm hoping the turn around from ignoring the meme to at least semi embracing it will help.	commoncoitusy	78630	2963	2
	1618497861.0	You have 90 days probably, so you probably have some to go. Is your account locked? Do you have the little message below your portfolio chart? I would contact them and say you're trying to exercise the options. They should automatically exercise them if they are in the money an hour before expiration but IDK in this case. It's best to try to contact them anyway you can....	apianti	5312	1583	1
