	1618486376.0	News and information out of GameStop has been dropping left and right lately. I'm excited for more news that could drop today or through the end of the week. We can still expect the 2021 Meeting proxy documents, and an official press release from gamestop regarding the search for a CEO that Reuters reported. Gamestop is still operating with an interim CFO, so they may still announce a hire for that position. I wonder what other surprises are in store? ******** 8 April: [GameStop Announces Slate of Director Candidates for 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-slate-director-candidates-2021-annual-meeting) 12 April: [Reuters reports Gamestop is searching for a replacement for CEO ](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gamestop-ceo-exclusive/exclusive-gamestop-initiates-search-for-new-ceo-sources-idUSKBN2BZ290) 13 April: [GameStop Announces Voluntary Early Redemption of Senior Notes](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-voluntary-early-redemption-senior-notes-0) 14 April: [Gamestop SEC filings show forfeiture of 706,096 total shares by CEO Sherman and EVP/CMO Homeister for failing to meet performance goals.](https://news.gamestop.com/financial-information/sec-filings)	YouAreAPyrate	42008	14011	171

	1618496932.0	"# Guys I can't believe some of you still dont understand.This will moon when AND ONLY WHEN there is a forced buyback :man_facepalming_light_skin_tone: **How to achieve forced buyback?** 1. Share recall 2. Margin call 3. Small raw buying pressure to push unhedged new options ITM so that hedging provides 'free' upward movement on TACTICAL MOMENTS ONLY. 4. Forced liquidation by DTCC 5. Hard intervention by the SEC Unless one of these happens, the price can go anywhere.... and it doesn't matter if it's $200 or $40 a share... **Red days dont mean the squeeze is off, green days dont mean the squeeze is on. The price is fucking irrelevant (unless you're buying, then big red days are something to celebrate)** You should stop caring. We've been saying this for months, but everytime we have a green day you guys want to celebrate and cheer because ""where lambo"" like a bunch of spoiled children. And on red days you freak out way too much. **Get fucking patient** For those 5 catalysts that I listed there are many things 'in the works'. The DTCC is spewing new regulations like a toddler that ate too much icecream. There is a shareholder vote 9th of June, GME hasn't released what we'll be voting on however. SEC just got a new head that is known to be anti hedgefund bullshit. **What is important?** \- Buy if you can. This determines how much exposure you have once we moon. More shares is more tendies. \- HOLD. Seriously. Don't daytrade, don't sell. Just hold. Doesn't matter if we're down 50% or up 40%. Stop giving a shit. This will only moon if there are not enough shares to go around. By holding, you are taking your shares and you're saying ""These are mine now. Less to go around"". \- Stop fucking promising yourselves dates. Especially if you're smoothbrained. Don't get excited at all. Stop it. You're setting yourself up for constant dissapointment which will paperhand you and ruin this for yourself. Yesterday I told you not to overcelebrate and I was told to fuck off and not ruin the fun. See where the fun yesterday got you? Totally (and without good reason) totally dissapointed today. **Not fucking advice, go ahead and be stupid if you think that's better**"	Damsellindistress	32909	10903	546
	1618499641.0	"# you dumb apes want to hear a secret? Max pain is at 150 :man_shrugging_light_skin_tone: Long whales are going to defend that point to bleed large option owners. You know who owns lots of options? People who needed to buy them to reset FTDs and huge short positions. That's who. We will hover around 150 all day and that is a good thing for us. ""Red bad, green good"" is such an ape-unworthy simpleminded approach to this. Grow some wrinkles for gods sake. Do you want $200 as a price today if that helps shorts by letting them make a shitload of money on options? If you're saying yes then you're seriously almost a real ape. **Smart apes know that to win the war you don't have to win every battle.

I’m not selling until either an absurd number in a squeeze, or until I more than double my initial investment if the squeeze never comes because the system is broken, so I stopped watching. I’ll check periodically just to see, but at this point, there’s really no reason for me to look. I have my shares that I will hold, so any small price fluctuations don’t do me any good to watch.

Do you one better: the S.E.C has their own judges so technically they can legit do whatever the fuck they please under their own scrutiny. They operate outside traditional federal courts. For example daddy musk and Cuban didn’t go into a federal court for their hearing they went to an S.E.C court with an S.E.C appointed judge getting tried for securities fraud by S.E.C employees/lawyers.	plomii	22723	936	44

	1618501985.0	Its funny that when my 2 other baby stock's price decreases and are -15%, i get a little mad at them and close my eyes for 3sec to take a deep breath. But when gme gives me -55% before, it didnt concern me at all and even bought some additional ammo. I think its time to turn my portfolio to 100% GME to avoid this madness.	Jakonedrom	1780	363	22
